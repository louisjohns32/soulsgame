# soulsgame
A-level coursework unity game inspired by Dark Souls

*There are some bugs and unfinished aspects due to time constraints* 

Controls:
WASD - movement
Left click - attack
Space - roll/dodge
Q - target enemy

I suggest reading the development section of the documentation for a general overview of the code.
